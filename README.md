## Overview

This was my second project on the General Assembly SEI. We were divided up in pairs and given 28 hours to build a React.js app which consumed a public API. 

With my team mate we started talking about which kind of an app we would enjoy building and being fans of the board game Trivial Pursuit we decided to build a quiz API. 


## Brief
* **Consume a public API** â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.
* **The app can have a router** - with several "pages", this is up to your disgression and if it makes sense for your project.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

## Key Learnings

The project was invaluable in terms of working as a pair and learn how other people approach code. 

We also didn't want to use Bulma at first but then decided to switch as we had limited time, which taught us to be adaptable. 

I believe I didn't spend enough time on planning with my last project and started coding too fast which ended up slowing me down. Having limited time this time around pushed us to plan well in a way. We decided what our MVP was and what were our stretch goals, which features were priority and which were "nice to have". This kept us focused as we had a clear to-do list.

## Future Features

* If I had more time I would have liked to add difficulty levels. The API had the option to return games based on different difficulties but our time constraint prevented us from exploring this option.

* We would have also liked to add a two-player version that would also display a winner in the end.
